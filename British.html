      <h3><span>EYFS</span></h3>
      <p>
        In the British school system, there is no specific term "kindergarten." Instead, early education for children
        aged three to five is referred to as the Foundation Stage within the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)
        framework. Here's a summary:

        Age Group: Foundation Stage is for children aged three to five, including the final year of nursery and the
        Reception year.

        Curriculum: The EYFS framework focuses on seven areas of learning and development, covering various aspects such
        as personal, social, and emotional development, literacy, mathematics, and more.

        Play-Based Learning: The emphasis is on play-based learning, allowing children to explore and develop skills
        through a combination of planned and child-initiated activities.

        Assessment: Ongoing observation and assessment are used to track each child's progress in different areas. This
        helps tailor support to individual needs.

        Transition: Foundation Stage serves as a transition to Key Stage 1, providing a solid foundation for future
        learning.

      <h3><span>Elementary</span></h3>
      <p>
        The elementary stage in the British school system consists of Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7) and Key Stage 2 (ages
        7-11). The curriculum includes core subjects such as English, Mathematics, and Science, with additional subjects
        introduced in Key Stage 2. The teaching approach focuses on foundational skills, and assessments, including
        SATs, may be conducted in Year 2 and Year 6. The transition to secondary school occurs at the end of Year 6. The
        curriculum aims to provide a well-rounded education, emphasizing academic, physical, and social development.
        Extracurricular activities and a holistic approach contribute to a comprehensive educational experience.
